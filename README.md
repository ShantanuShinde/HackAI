## ✨ What is Sign-opsis?

**Sign-opsis** is an AI-powered tool that **converts audio** from videos, podcasts, and live streams into **sign language** using **AI-powered avatars**. By providing real-time **visual translation**, it makes spoken content accessible to the **Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community**, enhancing inclusion in education, entertainment, and beyond.

It’s not just translation — it’s **communication empowerment**.

---

## 💡 Challenge Statements

- 🌍 **Green Trails**: By fostering educational equity and inclusion, **Sign-opsis** helps advance **sustainable development goal #4 (Quality Education)** and #10 (Reduced Inequalities).
- 🎓 **Learnin’ the Ropes**: For the DHH community, Sign-opsis ensures access to **audio-based content** in real-time, empowering them to participate in conversations and learning environments globally.

## 🚀 What Can It Do?

- 🎧 **Input**: Audio from videos, podcasts, or live captions  
- 🤟 **Output**: A 3D avatar performing sign language  
- 🌐 **Multilingual**: Supports different **regional sign languages** (e.g., ASL, BSL, ISL, etc.)
- 🔁 **Real-Time Mode (Stretch Goal)**: Live caption-to-sign for streamed content  
- 🧠 **Smart Parsing**: Automatically segments spoken content into visual-friendly signed chunks

### 📌 Problem Statement
Millions of people around the world are deaf or hard of hearing and may rely on sign language as their primary mode of communication. However, the majority of media content—podcasts, videos, interviews, news clips—are audio-based or contain audio components without accessibility options. Subtitles help, but they don't fully bridge the gap for those who are fluent in sign language, as it’s a distinct language with its own grammar and structure.

### 💡 The Idea
Develop a tool called **Sign-opsis** that automatically converts the audio from a video (or just an audio file) into a sign language video, where a 3D animated avatar or pre-recorded human interpreter performs sign language synchronized with the audio content.

### 🎯 Use Case / Impact
- **Deaf communities** can access spoken content in their native language (ASL, BSL, etc.).
- **Educational videos** become more inclusive.
- **Podcasts and lectures** become accessible without needing real-time interpreters.
- **Government/public announcements** can be made accessible rapidly in emergency situations.

## ⚙️ How to Implement This (Step-by-Step)

### 1. **Speech Recognition (ASR)**
   - **Goal**: Use Automatic Speech Recognition to transcribe the audio.
   - **Tools**: Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper by OpenAI, DeepSpeech
   - **Output**: Time-stamped transcription of spoken content

### 2. **Text-to-Sign Language Translation**
   - **Goal**: Translate the transcribed spoken language (e.g., English) into sign language grammar.
   - **Note**: This is not direct word-to-word mapping. It involves grammatical restructuring.
   - **Tools**: NLP models trained to translate English sentences into ASL gloss (a written representation of ASL).

### 3. **Sign Language Animation Generation**
   - **Option A**: **3D Animated Avatar**
     - Feed ASL gloss into a 3D avatar system (like SignAll, Project IRIS, or Microsoft’s avatar research) that animates hand signs and facial expressions.
     - Use motion capture data or generative models to animate.
   - **Option B**: **Pre-recorded Interpreter Clips**
     - Stitch together a sequence of pre-recorded sign language gestures based on the translated ASL gloss.
     - Similar to how text-to-video synthesis works.

### 4. **Video Synchronization**
   - **Goal**: Synchronize the avatar/interpreter with the original video’s timeline.
   - **Method**: Use time-stamps from the speech-to-text phase.
   - **Output**: PiP-style (Picture-in-Picture) video: Original content + interpreter window.

### 5. **User Interface**
   - **Goal**: Allow users to upload audio/video files and choose the target sign language.
   - **Feature**: Generate and download accessible video.
   - **Optional**: Real-time streaming support for live content (advanced).

## 🧠 Tools & Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C++
- **Libraries**: PyTorch/TensorFlow (for ML), OpenCV (for video processing), FFmpeg (for encoding/decoding)
- **APIs**: Google Speech-to-Text, DeepL or OpenAI API for translation assistance, Blender for animation
- **Frameworks**: React + Node.js for frontend/backend; Flask or Django for RESTful service

---

## 📈 Future Potential

- Add support for multiple sign languages (BSL, ISL, etc.).
- Add facial expression generation (important in ASL).
- Integrate with Zoom, YouTube, or Google Meet for live translation.
- Create an offline version for areas with poor internet.
- **Take audio/video in any language**, convert audio/video to text transcript in English, summarize the text, and convert it to a 3D avatar explaining in sign language with text/audio subtitles.
